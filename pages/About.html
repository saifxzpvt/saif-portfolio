        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">Hi, I'm Saif ali!</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
          I'm a software developer with a passion for building innovative and
          user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
          I was born in 2005, and my journey into the world of technology began
          in 2020. From the moment I wrote my first lines of code, I was
          captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. Since
          then, I have been continuously expanding my skills and knowledge,
          evolving from a curious learner to an aspiring full-stack developer. I
          specialize in frontend development, crafting clean and responsive user
          interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring the
          backend with Java to build robust and scalable applications. My tech
          toolkit also includes Python, which I’ve used to develop practical
          projects like a currency converter, a password suggester, and even a
          small chatbot that responds to specific inputs. Beyond coding, I have
          a keen eye for UI/UX design, creating intuitive and user-friendly
          prototypes using Figma, and I efficiently manage projects using Git
          for version control. I am passionate about learning, problem-solving,
          and turning ideas into real-world applications. With every project, I
          aim to enhance my skills, stay updated with industry trends, and take
          steps toward becoming a proficient full-stack developer. My goal is to
          create innovative solutions that make a difference and push the
          boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an enthusiastic frontend developer with a solid grasp of HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript, focused on building responsive, user-friendly,
          and visually appealing web applications. Currently, I am expanding my
          skill set by learning backend development with Java, aiming to become
          a full-stack developer. I have worked on several projects that have
          improved my ability to write clean, optimized code and implement
          modern web practices. My design process is enhanced by my proficiency
          in Figma, allowing me to create wireframes, prototypes, and UI/UX
          designs that deliver seamless user experiences. I also have a strong
          understanding of Git, ensuring smooth version control, collaboration,
          and code management throughout the development cycle. I am passionate
          about problem-solving, continuous learning, and staying up-to-date
          with emerging technologies. I enjoy taking on new challenges and am
          committed to improving both my frontend and backend skills to deliver
          scalable and efficient solutions.

        <h2 style="font-size: 2rem;">My Projects</h2>

        <div class="project-card">
          <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
          <p>
            Built a responsive personal portfolio showcasing my skills and
            projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you can see also
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
          <h3>Todo List App</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a dynamic to-do list app with JavaScript, allowing users
            to add, update, and delete tasks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
          <h3>Weather App</h3>
          <p>
            Created a weather application using APIs to fetch real-time weather
            data based on user location.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
          <h3>Currency exchange app (python)</h3>
          <p>
            I developed a Currency Exchange application using Python that allows
            users to convert currencies accurately and efficiently. The
            application fetches real-time exchange rates from reliable sources,
            ensuring up-to-date currency conversions. It features a
            user-friendly interface where users can select different currencies,
            input amounts, and instantly view the converted value. The project
            highlights my skills in Python programming, API integration, and
            data handling. I implemented error handling to manage invalid inputs
            and ensure smooth user interactions. This project not only
            strengthened my understanding of data manipulation and external API
            usage but also improved my ability to develop practical, real-world
            applications.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
          <h3>Password suggestor app (python)</h3>
          <p>
            I developed a Password Suggester application using Python that
            generates strong and secure passwords based on user-defined input
            length. This project focuses on enhancing user security by creating
            randomized passwords with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase
            letters, numbers, and special characters. Users can specify their
            desired password length, and the application ensures the password
            meets modern security standards for better protection against
            unauthorized access. Through this project, I strengthened my skills
            in Python programming, including working with random libraries,
            handling user inputs, and implementing logical conditions. It
            reflects my ability to build practical applications and highlights
            my focus on user-centric and secure software solutions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
          <h3>Chatbot (python)</h3>
          <p>
            I developed a small chatbot application using Python that interacts
            with users by responding to specific inputs. The chatbot is designed
            to recognize predefined keywords and phrases, delivering accurate
            and relevant replies. Through this project, I gained hands-on
            experience in handling user input, implementing conditional logic,
            and improving the chatbot's ability to process text-based
            communication. This project enhanced my understanding of Python
            programming, string manipulation, and control flow while offering
            insight into building interactive applications. I aim to expand its
            functionality by integrating advanced responses and enhancing the
            user experience further.
