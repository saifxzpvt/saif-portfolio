Here is the comprehensive plan for improving the mobile view of the site:

### Plan:
1. **Navigation Menu:**
   - Ensure the JavaScript function `toggleMenu()` is implemented correctly to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu on mobile devices.
   - Adjust the CSS for the `.right ul` to ensure it displays correctly when the menu icon is clicked.

2. **Responsive Layout Adjustments:**
   - Review and modify the CSS for sections to ensure they stack properly on smaller screens. This may involve adjusting flex properties and margins.
   - Ensure that buttons and other interactive elements have sufficient padding and size for easy tapping on mobile devices.

3. **Testing:**
   - After making the changes, test the site on various mobile devices or emulators to ensure the layout and functionality are working as expected.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
